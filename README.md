chsh -s $(which zsh)
```

3. **Verify Docker Installation**
```bash
docker run hello-world
```

4. **Monitor GPU Usage**
```bash
nvtop
```

```bash
# OR if you want to tinker a bit more ...
watch -n 1 nvidia-smi

# Monitor GPU Temperature
watch -n 1 nvidia-smi | grep -E 'GPU|Fan|Temp'

# List All Running GPU Processes
nvidia-smi pmon -c 1
nvidia-smi pmon -c 1 -s um

# Monitor GPU Memory Usage
watch -n 1 nvidia-smi | grep -E 'GPU|Fan|Temp|Memory'
```

5. **Monitor CPU Usage**

htop
```

6. **Monitor Memory Usage**
```bash
free -h
```

7. **Monitor Disk Usage**

### Global NPM Permissions

```bash
mkdir ~/.npm-global
npm config set prefix '~/.npm-global'
echo 'export PATH=~/.npm-global/bin:$PATH' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

### Rust Environment Not Found

  ```bash
  source ~/.cargo/env
  ```

### 🗃️ GIT LFS - https://git-lfs.com/

  Download: https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs/releases/download/v3.7.0/git-lfs-linux-amd64-v3.7.0.tar.gz  -> run install.sh with sudo

  Inside the GIT repository where you have large files (over 100mb), run the following commands:
  ```bash
  #1
  git lfs install
  #2 track
  git lfs track "*.psd"
  git lfs track bedrock_server
  ```
  That's it! You may run the rest of the GIT commands normally.
